## Fall 479: The Bear of Imber

The senior squires of Vagon Castle train under the watchful eye of Sir Elad, Marshall of Sir Roderick[^1] and Castellan of Vagon Castle. As usual per Vagon mornings, we are tested in the arts of battle. First we are sent charging at lance against a stationary target and then, at our success, we face the dreaded quintain. The terrible construct is menacing, but the three squires each succeed at the lance, and keep their saddle as the wooden arms swing back. Elad is pleased and approving of our skill, and offers us opportunity.

Eager to send the almost-knights into the earlship at large, Sir Elad tells us of the rumors of a man-eating bear terrorizing the local village of Imber. The Lord of that village is absent at business, and Elad offers us this chance to prove our candidacy as knights. We accept energetically. As he sets us off the next day, Sir Elad suggests a horse race to determine a leader. Eager to show the superiority of the Roman ways, Elvorix rides as hard as he can, while his companions Iwan and Vandagild, modestly shying from command, hold back to allow the Roman to win. He notices their ploy and admonishes their mischief, accepting leadership nonetheless.

A leader “decided”, the squires push north, through Elvorix's lands of Shrewton, past Tilshead and over the hills to Imber. There, we meet with Old Garr, a greying local, who welcomes the squires and laments the absence of his own Lord. He tells us of the bear rumors and offers to take us to the location of last sight. Elvorix leads the trio into the forest, looking confident but poorly masking his discomfort. We amble aimlessly for a few moments. Vandagild, famed as a hunter and squired to the Earl’s Huntsman Sir Golistan, asks Elvorix if he’d like some help tracking down the bear. Elvorix accepts, his relief palpable; his sense of direction is famously bad, and his Roman pride prevents him asking for aid. We track the bear to its lair; Vandagild approaches skilfully and takes the bear unawares, his steed navigating the woodland terrain and his lance piercing the ursine hide! The bear roars, rears, and retaliates as the other squires engage. A battle ensues, and the men slay the fierce creature with uncommon skill, the bear unable to muster effective resistance! Iwan, in his quiet modesty, fights well. As the squires take trophies from the beast, Vandagild offhandedly questions if the bear is a man-eater at all. Elvorix, then, a surgeon of Roman training, examines the beast’s gut for signs of manflesh… to his shock the bear hasn’t eaten any people at all!

As the squires return to Imber to share the news, they stumble upon a villager’s house... Two men, armed, loiter in the yard; sounds of distress emit from within; the poor folk are being raided by our dreaded enemy, the Saxons! The squires spur their mounts, as the third Saxon emerges with a struggling Cymric farmer… The Saxon arrows and their clumsy axes are no match for the three sturdily armoured and mounted men of knightly training; few wounds are sustained as our nobler arms spill foreign blood into the earth. The peasant is grateful, of course; it is the lot of the peasant to be saved by the noble, of course; and to grovel in gratitude. We surmise that these savages have been the thorn in Imber’s side; a foul and unexpected fate for such northern lands, to be spoiled by the boots of Saxons. At least their lifeless bones may now bring fertility to British fields. The squires return to Imber and tell the villagers that the threat is over, before encouraging them to return to their plots and toil. Old Garr is grateful! The three squires, flushed with the thrill of battle and the glory of hunt, return to Castle Vagon, to tell Sir Elad of their success, and the ill tidings of Saxons so far northwest…

## Winter 479

Those familiar with the long-haired, Visigothic folk of Gallia Aquitania, know that many of these continental men take after their enlightened King Lancelot I. Such readers will, therefore, have foremost in mind two things: The terrible betrayal of the Aquitanians by Rome and the revengeful sacking of that holy city; and the Aquitanian adeptness for Romance. Thus it was of little surprise to many that, at a Winter feast, the flirtatious Squire Vandagild succumbs to his indulgence and recklessness, and is struck by a passion of lust! Complicit in this endeavour is the daughter of his Lord, The Pictish Huntsman Sir Golistan! Truly such a betrayal of lordship and honor does little good to the young man’s name. Vandagild rapidly admits his error with a passionate and well-delivered speech, but yet declares his love; the couple have grown fond over their shared years in Golistan’s house, and he wishes her hand. Lady Catrin, however, is now pregnant. Vandagild is at Sir Golistan’s mercy.

Golistan, a famously proud, yet prudent man, is familiar with the consequences of excess. He and Vandagild’s father grew close in their many battles under the High King Aurelius, and being both foreigners to Salisbury. Our families have appreciated one another's company during many feasts and celebrations. Vandagild’s mistake has placed this relationship in jeopardy.

Soon while at hunt, Sir Golistan sends Vandagild to check traps some way from the party. Unbeknownst, he is followed: His keen perception espies Golistan approaching, armed. A shield is flung at the foolish squire’s feet. Conversation is unnecessary; a test occurs. Vandagild is the taller man, but Golistan is a veteran of many battles, and famed for his Pictish spearmanship. Men talk of him slaying a Great Boar in a single blow, the head of which is hung with pride above his great table. Vandagild wishes not to join it.

Steel cuts the air, and shields are rent. Vandagild holds his blows at first, but his own flowing blood puts talk of such modesty to rest, and Golistan shows no restraint. Blood is drawn on both sides, but Vandagild's blade is manoeuvred with spectacular might, for his arm and heart are Impassioned by his Love for Catrin! Golistan loses his feet on two occasions, unbalanced by the strength of the young man’s assault. His passionate swordsmanship proves equal to Golistan's spear, and the latter yields, muddied and sore. Vandagild prostrates himself in apology, which draws him another blow to the face. If he is to marry Lady Catrin, he must be strong. There is little mercy on the battlefield, and Golistan will not have his daughter wed to a meek man, to die on the field and leave her aggrieved. Vandagild swears to fight well for her.

Vandagild is married two weeks later, and there is no bitterness. The nuns declare twins are growing...

It is rumoured that the other Squires had their own events of this winter, but these tales will emerge in good time.
