## Spring 480

Roderick issues orders: His finest knights are to ride east to Wynchbank to assess the fitness of that Baron’s Daughter as a wife for the good Earl. Each squires knight is to be among the modest cohort, and thus each squire will attend. Before we leave, Vandagild gifts his two companions with a finely crafted Bear Claw medallion each, paid for with the animal’s pelt, as a token of our camaraderie.

On the road:

Elvorix helps peasants with a broken wagon, not straying so far as to render dishonorable manual labor, and yet building his reputation as a fine man.

Vandagild talks battle with Iwan. Elvorix, overhearing, claims written treatises of Good Roman Strategy, in Latin, are apparently stored in Sarum! As a reading man (uncommon in these lands), Vandagild makes note to partake of them. The Knight Sir Leofmund interjects with some disdain: He declares the benefit of real battle, and suggests we prefer experience over literature. We are humbled.

Iwan spends time practicing with his blade, learning from the senior knights and showing his own skill. He duels Elvorix with wooden swords; Iwan gets the better, though brags little for his success!

At dinner, Wynchbank Manor

The lady (of 13 summers, not yet marriageable, but these things take time) is slightly late, and, to Vandagild’s romantic estimation, dressed less fancifully than our Lord Roderick deserves. Vandagild suspects this is a deliberate show of disrespect or disinterest. While feasting, Iwan attempts flirtation with a serving woman, but nets no gain. His dashing looks impress, but he is squired to Sir Myles, renowned as perhaps the most handsome man in court; competition is fierce. Vandagild, drawing from recent experience, humbly warns him of the risks of imprudence at feasts. Iwan appropriately admonishes Vandagild for his hypocrisy.

The next morning, we are awoken before dawn. News comes with the shock of awakitude: The Marshall Sir Elad, our mentor from Vagon, is coming from Sarum\* !? He brings the Squire Madoc with him, who looks particularly proud today. It is important that we are ready to travel with the good Marshall. The reason is kept in shadows.

An interjection: I have been remiss. Madoc has squired with us for our duration in the rank. He was supposed to ride with us to Imber, but was drawn away with no warning and thus omitted from the tale. He is strong and resilient, and famously Energetic, Proud and Temperate. Madoc and Vandagild have shared joyous moments, and both take virtue from vengeance. He is excellent at Lance, and hates Saxons. He is of unknown origin; we presume the favourite of some Widower and thus supported in Knighthood, or perhaps the bastard of some Baron or officer. His appearance at Wynchbank with Sir Elad surprises.

On his arrival, Sir Elad brings news: We are to travel to Londinium! We will be as part of Earl Roderick's entourage, attending the High King's Easter Feast! A glorious occasion and a treat for inglorious squires! We trek, still uncertain for Madoc.

Londinium!

London's walls are dilapidated. Elvorix notes the superiority of Roman stonemasonry and the shame of the current state of these walls. The Squires all hate it here, for different reasons; It is dense, dirty, bereft of forest or game, and awash with politics. And it stinks. We enter the west gate, the wretched pall of skinworks assails every nostril for a mile. As we travel, Vandagild asks the dashing Sir Myles for help buying jewellery for Lady Catrin from the fine cratfsfolk of London; Myles eagerly acquiesces.

We follow Sir Elad to meet the Earl Roderick. Sir Godifer^ and Earl Roderick embrace, affirming their friendship. Sir Roderick then greets Squire Madoc specifically, and before other Knights; a truly unusual honour! A brief conversation, which the deft Iwan overhears: Roderick is excited about an announcement regarding Madoc, though the details are not explained. Roderick then greets the three protagonistic squires, firmly shaking our hands: We have shown quality and reached our twenty first year. As such we are to be Knighted! Glorious!

As we converse, Roderick asks Sir Godifer about Wynchbank: Godifer explains that the Baron apparently has his estate under excellent care, and he's a diligent man. His daughter is respectable, but Godifer speaks with some trepidation about her lack of appropriate opulence. When asked, Vandagild echoes and amplifies Godifer's comments of her outfit, and adds a note of her lateness. Roderick frowns.

That evening: Vandagild romances his lady and offers her his gift: A delicate necklace wrought from fine Silver! She is grateful and speaks kindly. As we carouse, Elvorix strides among the squires, admonishing them for being intemperate with drink. This is an unpopular act. Iwan leaves the party, continuing to hate London while wandering the miserable streets and regretting the stench.

As the Knighthood tradition dictates, we spend the evening in churches, praying to God and resisting Sloth. Each man achieves his goal and succumbs not to sleep in the house of Our Lord, yet we do not share the moment: Elvorix is Roman Christian, Iwan British Christian and Vandagild an Arian Christian#. The latter sits with few others in a smaller chapel and yet appears possessed in his dedication to wakefulness. Unbeknownst to him, an Arian Bishop observes his fervour, whispering prayers and thanks to God for this omen. Auspicious!

We are Knighted before the High King!

The next morning we sit in the High King’s court, a truly magnificent ceremony, attended by the greatest men and women of Logres and Britain. Prince Uther, brother of the High King Aurelius Pendragon, sits at the latter’s right hand. The pageantry and ceremony overwhelm!

We are knighted before the High King himself, a privilege few Knights are granted. We modestly ascribe this to our convenient location among the cohort of Salisbury, for none of us are of particularly worth stock. The proceedings underway, shocking news is soon declared. One Squire remains to be Knighted. Uther himself stands before Madoc, and he declares the young man to be his son! An heir for Uther, and another Noble Prince in the lands of Britain! Madoc, now royalty, utters his Knightly vows among the raucous cheers of Britain’s finest!

At dinner we are seated appropriately as new Knights! Sir Elvorix proudly tells the tale of how he (with a little help) killed the Bear of Imber! Sir Vandagild brings his family together: His wife the Lady Catrin, whose belly swells already, his father and mother, his youngest brother (Vandimund), The Huntsman Sir Golistan, and other members. He orates powerfully and shares with them his joy and gratitude to celebrate such a wonderful occasion in such a glorious place, with these, his finest people.

Iwan spends his time quietly with Sir Myles, enjoying pleasant conversation and flattering attention, developing a strong love for his mentor.

The High King's Easter Feast!

At the Feast Proper, the new Knights are seated with Roderick's entourage, near the salt. That evening:

Sir Elvorix locates yon fool, some knight from the Saxon Shore, to exploit in some gambling over chess: Elvorix defeats him! The enraged victim, Sir Cedifor, takes his feet and accuses Elvorix of cheating! Elvorix deftly defends himself verbally, but is nonetheless forced to defend himself physically: A duel is declared! They step outside and draw blades; a crowd gathers and wagers made! Space clears, and coifs are donned as the man lock eyes. The two engage, blades slashing and sparking! After a tense and testing moment, Elvorix outmanoeuvres his opponent and brings his sword down on the Easterner's head, knocking him to dust. Elvorix nobly allows his opponent to rise, and is promptly struck in the ribs, before urgently deflecting a series of furious blows with his shield. On the back foot, Elvorix takes a solid blow which cuts through his mail and into his shoulder. The blow is returned, once more knocking the Shoresman to the ground! He doesn't yield, and Elvorix presses his advantage! Blow after blow slams into the man's shield and armour, before Elvorix slides his blade into an opening, pressing down with his weight! Blood flows freely, and Sir Cedifor resentfully yields through gritted teeth. Victorious! The crowd cheer! The young knight returns to the feast, bloodied but glorious. Despite this show, much later another eastern knight (also under Duke Ventrius of the Saxon Shore) challenges his loyalty - Sir Elvorix boldly affirms his passionate glory for his Lord, to the satisfaction of all present! The other man is forced to withdraw in shame.

Meanwhile, Sir Iwan drinks little for his temperance. Nearby nobles ask for his comment on the wine, fearing dissatisfaction or insult – He speaks well, his comments well received and no insult given! Later, a lady (A daughter of a Baron in Saxon Shore, no less!) asks the handsome Sir Iwan to lead the next dance. Iwan does so aptly, a fine time had by all. He spends time speaking with the lady, but his western courtesy matches poorly with her shoreswoman ways, and he stumbles into repeatedly, and awkwardly inquiring about her father’s wealth and lands. She and others are unimpressed. Dejected, Sir Iwan returns to his seat. On the way, he espies Sir Myles' sister (The Lady Eleri) receiving disrespectful words from some lesser knight from Saxon Shore - intolerable! These folk are proving tiresome, and unworthy of their place in the High King’s feast! Iwan confronts him, and the man apologises. Mighty!

Meanwhile, the Arian Bishop who espied Vandagild's tremendous wakefulness and holy possession takes the feast’s attention: He declares to all present that the young knight has been blessed by God, who shines upon him this evening! Vandagild believes this as evidence that he has overcome his recent challenges of lustfulness righteously in the eyes of The Lord. So driven, Vandagild orates skillfully to proclaim the generous hospitality, strength, and success of Aurelius and the Pendragons, who are blessed by Our Lord and driven to glory and prosperity. The Salisbury knights cheer with vigour! Later, he converses with Earl Roderick, declaring his intention to establish himself as a man of loyalty despite his recent missteps. The Earl takes the comments well, but warns that actions speak louder than words. Vandagild later chats with the local huntsmen outside, but is treated poorly by their scurrilous dogs. He courteously manages the situation to little gain. Inglorious hounds!

Vandagild's blessing by the Bishop and subsequent speeches are remembered fondly by the guests, to his credit and glory, his efforts somehow exceeding the excitement of Elvorix's duel and the grace of Iwan's dance!

We retire, each according to their place. The rooms are well furnished, and rest is good.

Alas, once more our morning rise is abrupt: The Monstrous, Treacherous Saxons are attacking Salisbury! All Knights are to take arms and muster at once!..
